It is with great honor and privilege to announce that I today received the EliteForsk travel grant. The Elite Research Travel Grant is DKK 200,000 and helps very talented PhD students to perform longer-term studies in some of the best research environments in the world. The prize was handed to me by her Royal Highness Crown Princess Mary of Denmark and the Danish Minister of Science, Technology, Information and Higher Education Tommy Ahlers.
