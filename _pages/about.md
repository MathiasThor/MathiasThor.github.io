I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree with [SDU Embodied Systems for Robotics and Learning](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/institutter_centre/embodied+systems+for+robotics+and+learning){:target="_blank"} at [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk/en){:target="_blank"}, supervised by Prof. [Poramate Manoonpong](http://www.manoonpong.com/){:target="_blank"}.

The primary aim of my research is to develop an adaptive locomotion controller that is able to recognize and adapt to different robot bodies and environments. A secondary objective is to have a simple and modular controller design, which can easily be expanded with various behavioral modules. The advantage of a modular structure is that the controller-modules can be designed and tested individually and that the controller may be expanded in the future, where new and interesting technologies may be discovered. In my PhD, I mainly use knowledge and tools from the area of Artificial Intelligence. This includes, but is not limited to, artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning, artificial central pattern generators, reservoir computing, and other neural learning mechanisms.

Before starting my Ph.D., I graduated as an MSc in Robot Systems the [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk/en){:target="_blank"}. In my Master’s thesis, I developed a Modular Robot Framework called MORF. The primary aim of MORF was for it to be easy and convenient to use, such that researchers can focus more on the locomotion controller of the robot and not the hardware.

<!--My current research interests include neural locomotion control of walking machines, learning/plasticity, dynamic simulations, and design of legged robotic systems including their software interface.-->
