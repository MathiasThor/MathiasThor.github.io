I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree with SDU Embodied Systems for Robotics and Learning at the University of Southern Denmark. I received an M.Sc. degree in Robot Systems from the University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark, in 2019.

My current research interests include neural locomotion control of walking machines, learning/plasticity, dynamic simulations, and design of legged robotic systems including their software interface.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
